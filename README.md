#                                 Applications
# Problem
During recent years, we have managed to make some steps towards a more sustainable future and we have made climate change a central perspective point in our decision-making. However, we still see so many antitheses between words, visions, roadmaps, hopes - and actions.

The liberalisation of electricity markets did not result in the creation of a truly competitive market, since pre-liberalisation positions are substantially intact. In addition, due to inefficient governance and decision-making, combined with high lobbying efforts, the climate change remains a problem of critical importance, while the rate of RES implementation meets legislative barriers.

# Solution
Pylon Network is structured with only one purpose: to create the first open, renewable energy exchange community, which will provide the energy markets with the signals and financial incentives that current energy policies and governance systems, are failing, or delaying to provide.

Users of Pylon can exchange green energy, bought directly from the RES producer and without need for intervention of intermediaries throughout the process, while Pylon-coin is utilized to reward the production of sustainable energy and financially support projects on sustainable technologies.

The technology to achieve our 100% sustainable development vision is out there and it works!

Pylon Network is here to accelerate its implementation.

# Technology
Pylon Network is a decentralized platform promoting decentralized energy technologies. Its operation is based on blockchain technology which gives the room for creation of trust mechanisms and data management at a decentralized scale.

By integrating our blockchain smart meter, Klenergy Metron, in the operation of Pylon Network and assigning them the role of validating all energy and currency transactions within the platform, it is possible to:

- Reward the production of green energy and,
- Connect grid-connected players (producers, consumers & prosumers) with stand-alone RES2 installations.

# Satellite Products & Services Integrated in the Pylon Network

# Metron

[METRON](http://metron.es) is the only blockchain-based, plug-and-play, energy monitoring system. It is designed to give meaningful insights of the users energy consumption while offering them a tool for “energy training”, to become energy efficient and smart consumers.

METRONs are used as verification nodes within Pylon Network for the direct exchange of energy and payments.

# Helios
The flagship of our products is our hydrogen, CHP3 storage solution, HELIOS. It taps on the competitive advantages of the most sustainable and most accessible fuel. It produces hydrogen thanks to the electrolysis reaction, without emitting any pollutant at all. In that way, it can store excess electricity in the form of compressible hydrogen - which renders it a unique solution for seasonal storage applications (up to months).

# DApps
The integration of blockchain technology in METRON and the operability with Pylon Network, allows for the decentralisation of governance by offering instantaneous smart contracts for exchange of energy-payments and the easy integration of various energy consumption data; all these into a convenient and "clean" energy dashboard, easily accessible from your smartphone, or your laptop (iOS app/Android app/Web).

# Green mining
The Green Miners constitute the pillar of the reward system implemented in Pylon Network; they are the vehicle that adds value to the generation of green energy, without adding further burden to the energy demand.

With “Green Mining” the correct incentives are in place, in order to prioritize own-consumption over consumption for "mining". With the proposed reward system and Green Mining model, we ensure that "mining" only occurs with electricity that would otherwise, go to waste – in other words, it does not add to the total energy consumption.
